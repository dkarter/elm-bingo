# Elm BuzzWord Bingo

This is a demo app that I built based on the Pragmatic Studio Elm course. It
creates a basic bingo web app for tracking buzzwords and keeping people engaged
during boring meetings

If you hear a buzzword during a meeting press the button. At the end of the
meeting points will be tallied up and attendees can win prizes, such as days off
🏄.
